## 🚀 About Me

I'm someone who thrives on curiosity. When an AI concept catches my interest—whether it's diffusion models, voice synthesis, or the inner workings of LLMs—I dive in deep, exploring research, building, and pushing boundaries until I create something useful, elegant, and intuitive. My passion is building tools that aren't just clever, but truly connect with people.
